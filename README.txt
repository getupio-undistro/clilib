Package <clilib> implements functions simulating Undistro's behavior as if
executed by a user.

The main goal of the library is to simplify the e2e test suite by grouping
common calls to Undistro's CLI commands into a single component. The library
also increases the extensibility of Undistro, permitting it to be controlled by
external programs.
